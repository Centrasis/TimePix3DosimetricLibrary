# TimePix3DosimetricLibrary
A basic library for dosimetric measurements with a TimePix3 detector

# Usage
Select in cmake whether you want to use a real katherine readout unit for data acquisition or simulate it via a file called SampleData.t3pa in the binary directory. The SampleData.t3pa can be the output of the katherine pixman or the ADVACAM tpx3 program.
The main object needed to start a measurement and register for events is the Tpx3DosageMeasurement object.
